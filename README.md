# Teleport Quick Start with Terraform

Are you looking at getting started with [Teleport?](https://goteleport.com/) Are you familiar with [HashiCorp Terraform?](https://www.terraform.io/) Then this repository is for you!

Whether you are testing Teleport for your home lab or work environment, or just want to learn something new, the purpose of this repository is to help you get started. 

The repository is split into three major components: 
1. Teleport Targets
   - IaC templates to create Teleport targets. This is the infrastructure that you will be accessing behind Teleport and includes SSH servers, Kubernetes clusters, databases and Windows Desktops.
2. Teleport Clusters
   - IaC templates to stand up the Teleport service itself.
3. Configuration (*Coming soon*)
   - IaC templates of Teleport configuration. 


Please visit the subdirectories for each component for instructions on how to use the Terraform code within.
